This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex,
make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

Simply running 'make' will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use scripts/flashing/flash.sh for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type make -C docs/ to build it.

Building your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system.
Cygwin will not be supported because of the lack of case sensitiveness.

Sunshine!

EasyBox 904 Notes
=================

The project is intended to use the EasyBox as simple IOT device with only network support.
It is possible to make use all of the 5 ports of the switch and run some services.
The kernel contains some USB support to boot the rootfs from a connected usb memory stick.
The vendor kernel is used as the switch kernel module is needed atm.

There fore it is useful to connect to the board via serial adapter.
(Of course you need the unlocked uboot, see https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=284534#p284534 how to flash).

The uboot which is built by this project accept all provided passwords in the same way the one at the openwrt post is used.
As addition the bootnum functionality is disabled to save some uboot settings re-flash cycles at boot.

The uboot environment variables has to be modified in the following way:
---
setenv addbootargs setenv bootargs \${bootargs} root=/dev/sda1 rootdelay=7 init=/etc/preinit rootfstype=ext2
setenv bootflash nand read.e \$(loadaddr) \$(f_kernel_addr) \$(f_kernel_size) \; run addip addmisc addbootargs \; bootm \$(loadaddr)
setenv bootcmd run bootflash
saveenv
---

The kernel is updated via (assume the uImage is in the current path, PLEASE refer to the ToDos at openwrt to avoid bricks
https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/arcadyanastoria/arcadyan_astoria_easybox_904xdsl_r01?s[]=904#installing_openwrt
):
--- 
flash_eraseall /dev/mtd2
nandwrite -p /dev/mtd2 uImage
---

The memory card should have a partition which contains the rootfs. The partition should correspond
to the uboot root setting  (e.g. /dev/sda1).
